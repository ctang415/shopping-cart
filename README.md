This was my first React project where I had to use the React router package and learn how to create dynamic routes/pages. I was really impressed by how easy it was to generate each individual product page just by running a map function through the array of products. Dynamic routing highlights just how valuable reusable components are because you save so much time by not having to copy and paste the same HTML for every single item. The template for the page is already stored in a component where it receives the product information that is passed as a property. 

And what I found even more amazing about React is the fact that the webpage will update immediately and seamlessly with the right React Hooks. As soon as I update the amount of candles I want to buy, the number of items in my bag will increase in the header and the final total will change in the checkout page. The whole process of navigating through the website whether it be from moving through the header links, clicking through the product pages, or adding and removing candles to/from the shopping bag is a smooth experience.

Though I may have struggled a bit in understanding how React router and React Hooks work, I can definitely see the importance in mastering them.
